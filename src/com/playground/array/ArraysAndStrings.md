# General Notes & Ideas

## Arrays

- Some problems may require an accumulative sum of the elements ex: arr: [1, 2, 3, 4] => accSum = [1, 3, 6, 10]
- Some problems may require sorting the array first
- Some problems may require operations on some ranges, so it is better to find the beginning of the range 
  (no elements to the left of it)
