# Greedy

- Shares some characteristics with DP but with no special conditions that might need backtracking
- Best Decision for the moment -> local optimal 
- Some solutions are optimal and others are suboptimal
- Try greedy approaches when a problem can't be solved with dp, and we are forced to use backtracking, especially when we 
  don't need to create different combinations; the result is just a number.
