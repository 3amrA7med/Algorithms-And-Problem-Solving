# DP 

## Fibonacci series questions

- in these type of questions our dp is 1D and only depends on 2 values,
  so we can easily use O(1) memory instead of O(n) 
- how to know if it is fibonacci ? the dp must depend on only 2 values.

## Palindromic substring problem

- can be solved with 2 ways, first one with dp and trying to find palindrome
  from the whole string first then decrement it
- second solution will be O(n^2) which is much better in this type of problem
  which we need to try to find the longest palindrome for each character as 
  mid-character for the palindrome in case of odd, special case for even,
  no dp in this solution
