## Algorithms 

### Bellman-Ford vs Dijkstra

- Bellman-ford can deal with negative cycles, while in dijkstra it can't.
- Bellman-Ford is used with problems that needs at most K nodes to be used.

### Minimum Spanning Tree

- There exists 2 algorithms to solve these types of problems:
  - Prim: easier in implementation.
  - Kruskal
